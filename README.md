# babetteAndroid
Risk styled game created for Android Application

An Android Studio based application, where my team and I created a game based upon the board game risk for my Second Year Project at University.

Babette Rules

The Game Map
The game map consists of two key components Fields and Areas.

Areas are sections of each Field. 
The Fields will be known as Cyber Security, Programming Languages, Computer Hardware,
Networking, E- Commerce and Development.

Their Areas would be the following

Cyber Security - Hacking, Phishing , Identify Theft ,Malware, Anti-Virus
Programming Languages – Java, SQL, Python, C++, HTML, JavaScript
Computer Hardware – Desktops, Laptops , Printers, Servers, Peripherals
Networking – Social, Business, Photo Sharing, Video Sharing, Live Streaming
E-Commerce – Marketplace, e-currency, delivery services, Online store, Digital Downloads
Development – Web Development, AI Development, Mobile Development , Government Systems
and Game Development

Type of Resources
Each Player, known as an Organisation, are given a number of resources known as units. These units
are placed within an area on the board and are used to determine which player controls an area.
Each unit has a value. The greater the value the stronger the unit thus the harder it is to defeat. The
units are as follows:

Team
This is the most basic form of unit and has a value of 1.

Business
This is the intermediate form of unit and has a value of 5.

Corporation
This is the most advanced form of unit and has a value of 10.

How Do You Distinguish From Each Player’s Resources?

Each player’s resources has a unique colour from the rest of the players resources on the board in
order to make it easier to distinguish who own certain resources.


When are you given resources?
You are given resources at the beginning of the game. Additionally, at the end of each turn to place
on area of your choice. Furthermore when you conquer an area and finally when trading Babette
Cards.

Babette Cards

Purpose of Card
The purpose of the cards is to allow players to gain extra resources allowing them to have an
advantage in the game or if the player has lost resources it allows them to make some form of a
comeback.

How do you gain cards?
Cards are gained when a player successfully ‘Calls for Merger’(attack other player’s field/area) and
gains their territory (field/area). Additionally cards can be gained every turn once a player holds
control over a complete field (owns all the areas within said field).

Card Structure and Trading Cards
This part of the card represents the type of resource
if the player successfully matches three of the same
type. Business Corporation or Team. They will gain an
extra resource of that type to place any where in the
territories(fields or areas) they hold.
This part of the card represents the type of field of
the card. If the player owns/controls any of these
fields they will gain double the amount of resources.


Wild Cards

How many cards can a player hold at one time?
A player can hold up to a maximum of 5 cards. Thus allowing for balance within the game.

What if the player can’t find a matching group of cards?
If the player has a maximum of 5 cards and cannot find a matching group of cards then the player
has the option of disposing cards. This disposing feature works by when the player is eligible to gain
a new card (defeats player or gains a territory) they are greeted with the option of disposing one of
the cards they already posses.
NOTE: When the player needs to dispose of a card to receive a new card they are unaware of the
nature of the card(type of resource/ field found on the card) before trading thus add a sense of
increased difficulty to the game.

What are Wild Cards?
These cards are special cards. There are two within the
entire playing of a game.
How are they used?
They are used as a substitute for a card if a player is
missing one from a set of matching cards. For example if
the player is missing one matching card for a Business
resource the wild card can be used(if within the player’s
card stack) to act as business resource thus allowing the
player to trade for a business resource.

Playing The Game

Set-Up
Before the game begins the user must choose between certain settings. These setting will include
the gameboard (map), amount of players and the difficulty level of the game. This selection stage
will occur on a separate game screen before the actual game will be played.

How many players can play?
Each game of Babette can be played by 2-4 players. One of course will be the user whilst the rest of
the players within the game will be AI.

How will the difficulty level of the game increase?
The difficulty level of the game will increase by giving the user less resources to begin with, less
resources for each territory they hold and less resources when they trade in Babette Cards.
Furthermore the resources given to the user at the beginning and after each round will be low end
resources rather than resources of higher quality .i.e. more teams than business and little to no
corporations.

After The Selection Stage

After the selection stage the game will begin. In order to decide who goes first a dice will be rolled.
The player with the highest dice roll will go first then rest of the user forthwith in descending order.
After this the players will then allocate resources (one at a time) until all the resources by each
player have been allocated to an area on the map.
Call For Merger

This feature of gameplay is when a player (either AI or the user) attacks an enemy’s control
area/field.
The user first select the field they are attacking from.

After the player must select an adjacent field to attack.
The attacker then rolls a dice as does the defender.
The player with the highest dice/die rolls win.

How many dice can be rolled?
Attacker
The amount of dice rolls at a time for an attacker will depend on how many resources they are
attacking with

Defender
The defender will defend with the maximum amount of die that they can based upon the amount of
resources they have on the area in a similar manner to which the attacking (call for merger) operates
i.e. if the defender has 1 resources they will defend with one dice, 3 resources 2 die etc.

How many resources can be attacked with?
The attacker can attack with the maximum amount of resources that they have on the area they are
attacking from with the exception that they must have one resource left on said area they are
attacking from. For example to attack with 3 resources the player must have 4 resources on the area
that are attacking from.

What if the attacker wins?
They gain the area they attacked/ call for merger on.

What if the attacker looses?
They loose all the resources that they attacked with.

Fortify
This part of the game is where players moves resources to adjacent areas in order to strengthen
their defence.

A player selects an area to move resources from.
Then the amount and type of resources from said area.
Note: At least on resource must be left on the area.

Finally the player then selects an area to move the resources to.
Then the area you would like to move the resources to.

How many times can you fortify in turn?

You can fortify (move resources) from one area at a time per turn.

How many resources can you move?
You can move every resource from an area with the exception that one resource must be left on said
field.

How to Win
The player wins the game once they have control over all the areas and their fields.

Loosing The Game
The player (AI or user) looses the game once they have no resources on any of the fields on the
gameboard. This will known as taking early retirement. The game will automatically end once the
user player has no resources left.

Quitting The Game
If the user player quits the game early then they are greeted to a similar screen as loosing with the
exception they are shown stats of their progress.
